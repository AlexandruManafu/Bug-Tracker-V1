A bug tracker implemented as a minimum viable product that focuses on the kanban board.

The application must be hosted and a database with its tables must be created (section 4.3 in technical.pdf) 
More information needed for hosting and trying the aplication can be found in the technical.pdf inside the documentation folder.
